# CakeTime

CakeTime allows the user to view several baking recipes. The user can tap
on a recipe and view the ingredients list and the steps that are required.
Most steps not only contain written descriptions but also contain videos.

The app has an optimized UI for large screens (tablets, TVs etc.).
A widget makes it possible to view the ingredient lists of every recipe on
the home screen. 
The app requires an internet connection as the data is fetched from a server.
